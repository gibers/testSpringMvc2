# testSpringMvc2
Spring webApp with jdbcTemplate, using save after @Verif data from form. 

I have taken the exemple from the book Spring in Action 4 : 
https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-fourth-edition

Click on "Source Code", download the zip. 
My testSpringMvc2 is related to "Chapter 5" in the zip. 

I have just transformed it to be managed with maven instead of gradle.
